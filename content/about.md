I was born and grew up in Beijing, China, and started to be interested in astronomy at UCSB as an exchange student during my undergraduate. I started my astronomy journey by studying the environmental effect on galaxy evolution. For the environments, I mean the large-scale structures, including clusters and protoclusters, and also local density. I also become interested in the feedback of radio galaxies to their surrounding environments and the ISM interaction with the morphology of radio jets. Now, I focus more on the normal galaxies, those without AGN, and how they grow their stellar. 


In my free time, I like snowboarding🏂, doing yoga🧘🏻‍♀️, and painting🎨, and many other things 🏝⛺️🏄🏻‍♀️ ...
