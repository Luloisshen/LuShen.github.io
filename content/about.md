I'm a currently a post-doc researcher at Texas A&M University, where I do research on **spatiallly-resolved star formation** in galaxy in the intermediate redshift ($z\sim1$) using *JWST* and *HST* data from surveys (including CEERS, NGDEEP, CANDELS and UVCANDELS).  

Before I joined TAMU, I worked at Univerisity of Science and Techonology of China (USTC). I was in the research group lead by Guilin Liu and focusing on the extended and powerful outflow driving by **red quasars** at $z\sim0.5$.  

I obtain my Ph.D. at Univeristy of Califorinia, Davis, supervised by Lori Lubin. During my Ph.D. and my first post-doc job, I mostly focus on **the role of environments** (i.e., clusters and protoclusters) in galaxy evolution using **ORELSE** survey for clusters at $z\sim1$ and **C3VO** survey for protoclusters at $z\sim2-5$. Particularly, I studied the environmental effect on radio galaxies, where radio emission is due to AGN and/or star formation activities, which allow us to study the coeval of AGN and star formation. 
I also collebrated with ALPINE collebration and 

In my free time, I like snowboarding🏂, doing yoga🧘🏻‍♀️, and painting🎨, and many other things 🏝⛺️🏄🏻‍♀️ ...
