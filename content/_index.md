Hi, I'm Lu Shen,

I'm a currently a post-doc researcher at Texas A&M University, where I do research on spatiallly-resolved star formation in galaxy in the intermediate redshift ($z\sim1$) using *JWST* and *HST* data from surveys (including CEERS, NGDEEP, CANDELS and UVCANDELS). 

I am also closely working with ORELSE and C3VO survey on the role of environments on galaxy evolution.
