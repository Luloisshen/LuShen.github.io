Hi, I'm Lu Shen,

I'm currently a post-doc researcher at Texas A&M University, where I do research on spatially-resolved star formation in galaxies in the intermediate redshift using *JWST* and *HST* data from surveys including CEERS, NGDEEP, CANDELS, and UVCANDELS.

Before I joined TAMU, I was at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), working with Guilin Liu on the powerful outflow driving by **red quasars** at $z\sim0.5$. 

I obtained my Ph.D. at the University of California, Davis, supervised by Lori Lubin. I mostly focus on **the role of environments** (i.e., clusters and protoclusters) in galaxy evolution using **ORELSE** survey for clusters at $z\sim1$ and **C3VO** survey for protoclusters at $z\sim2-5$. <!--Particularly, I studied the environmental effect on radio galaxies, where radio emission is due to AGN and/or star formation activities, which allow us to study the coeval of AGN and star formation. -->

<!--I also collebrated with ALPINE collebration to study the infrared-to-radio relation for high redshift star forming galaxies at $z\sim5$. -->
